                    Project: Replicating Materials’ Arithmetic Mean Height Using LRAs & Piezo Elements.

                    The goal of the investigation is to replicate specific surface characteristics of material using haptic technology. The haptic technology is significant to the progress of teleoperation (which is the operation of robots remotely), helping the visually impaired in interacting with their environments, and eventually, advancing the field of virtual reality. To achieve this, linear resonant actuators (LRAs) were first tested at different voltage inputs. The various voltage inputs would create differing displacement amplitudes, which are measured by piezo elements. Based on the arithmetic mean height (Ra) roughness parameter, greater amplitude would correspond to increased roughness. The range of Ra value created by the LRA is 8.830 μm to 13.02 μm, indicating that materials with Ra in that range can be replicated to a certain degree. Furthermore, the LRA was integrated into a haptic finger glove, allowing other people to experience it in the prototype stage.

                    Project: investigates the effects on efficiency as the plane angle between two coils varies.

                    Research question: to what extent does the degree of angular coil misalignment between two transmission coils affect the efficiency of power transfer in close range (2 cm displacement)?

                    This study explores electromagnetic induction, a fundamental aspect of electrical physics, gaining relevance in contemporary wireless technology. The investigation centres on the influence of angular coil misalignment on power transfer efficiency, enhancing our understanding of practical applications like phone charging pads, toothbrush chargers, and DC generators. The research systematically varies the transmitting coil angle from perfect alignment to perpendicular (0 to 90 degrees), analysing power transfer efficiency at 10-degree intervals. Confirming the predicted trend of increased power output with decreasing coil misalignment, the study highlights significant power loss at near-perfect alignment and near 90 degrees, attributed to a lack of magnetic resonance due to a relatively long displacement between coils. Additionally, the findings reveal an efficiency weakness, with maximum peak output power below 0.5% of input peak power, suggesting susceptibility to environmental factors like internal resistance in the copper coil. Despite the efficacy of circular coils, using different coil types for transmission and reception introduces a weakness, prompting further investigation into optimising wireless energy transfer systems by exploring the relationship between coil displacement and the most efficient angle.
