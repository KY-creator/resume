The various voltage inputs would create differing displacement amplitudes, which are measured by piezo disk elements. Based on the arithmetic mean height (Ra) roughness parameter, greater amplitude would correspond to increased roughness.

                                    Montreal Education Forum is a nonprofit educational organization that serves the Chinese immigrant community in the second largest city in Canada. I volunteer as a tutor for primary students who need assistance in academics and language learning. From orginginally teaching science in 2018 to now hosting oral english discussion, I have helped 40 new immigrant children every year to practice English conversation. Since April 2023, I have further taken my initiative to lead and train new tutros joining the nonprofit platform through videos and Q&A sessions.
